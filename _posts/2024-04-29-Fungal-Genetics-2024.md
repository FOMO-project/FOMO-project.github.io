With the organization on hands of [Dr. Anthony Amend](https://amendlab.com/) and with the assistance of the [Genetics Society of America](https://genetics-gsa.org/fungal/) for logistical support, a multidisciplinary group of mycologists were able to convene at the Fungal Genetics Conference 2024. 

The one-day workshop commenced with a discussion of the current state of marine fungal research. This was followed by a brainstorming session on potential protocols that could be employed to improve the estimation of marine fungi in the water column.

Also, the main objective of the workshop was to **develop a global collaborative research initiative: Fungal Oceanic Mycomass Observatory (FOMO)**

**Thanks to Adam Jones and the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation for workshop funding.**
