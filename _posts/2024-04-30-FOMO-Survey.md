It is well established that fungi play a significant role in the ecology of marine habitats. However, the abundance of these enigmatic organisms in comparison with bacteria remains poorly understood.

Do you have any insights on this topic?

**[BE PART OF OUR 30-SECOND FOMO SURVEY](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2Foqz4VMbbeQojWvOOLiADWIbCs5Dtb0AjqMjC01AsrXp-A/viewform?pli=1)**

This survey is focused to determine what experts believe is the best guess for marine fungal abundances in the ocean.
