The first marine mycology meeting was held in May 2018 at the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA. A group of mycologists convened with the primary objective of discussing the challenges of studying marine fungi and how to understand the identity and function of these organisms in the marine environment.

Thanks to Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Marine Biological Laboratory in Woods Hole, MA, for their financial support of the Marine Fungi Workshop.
